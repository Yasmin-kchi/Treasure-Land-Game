Welcome to Treasure Island! 

Your mission is to find the hidden treasure. 

As you begin your adventure, your first decision is to choose between left or right. 

Choosing left leads you to fall into a hole, ending the game. However, selecting right allows you to proceed further. 

The next challenge presents you with the choice to swim or wait. If you decide to swim, you will be attacked by a trout, resulting in another game over. 

Patience is rewarded, as waiting allows you to advance. 

The final decision involves choosing a door. 

Picking the red door will lead to being burned by fire, while the blue door results in being eaten by beasts. Both choices end the game. 

The correct choice is the yellow door, which leads you to the treasure and victory. 

Any other choice will also result in a game over. 

To succeed, remember: choose right, wait, and select the yellow door.

Good luck on your quest!
